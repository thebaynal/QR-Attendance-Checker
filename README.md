# QR-Attendance-Checker
This project modernizes attendance tracking by eliminating paper logs in favor of unique, student-specific QR codes.

# Mga Kulang pa na gagawin natin:
> User Side. They should be able to access their own qr code and download it. They can also register to events. Check if they are already present in the event. 
> Admin Side. They can access events, edit events, and check attendance through qr.

> Extra Features for ADMIN SIDE: [EXPORT THE DATABASE OF ATTENDANCE FOR AN EVENT]
